### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Adamczyk. People often call me Kuba, which is short for Jacob in Poland.

Software Engineering is my passion and profession at the same time.

My main area of expertise is React Native and Mobile Development in general. If you would like to hire me for consulting or as a part-time employee, reach out to me.

Apart from engineering, I like music, sports, cuisine, traveling, and movies.
