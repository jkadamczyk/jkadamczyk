### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub Adamczyk. People often call me Kuba, which is short for Jakub in Poland.

Software Engineering is my passion and profession at the same time.

My main area of expertise is React Native and mobile app development in general.

Apart from engineering, I like sports, music, cooking, and traveling.
