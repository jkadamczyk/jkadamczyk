### Hi 👋

My name is Jakub Adamczyk, but you can call me Kuba (pronounced /koobah/).

I'm a software engineer based in Wrocław, Poland. My main area of expertise is around crypto and mobile apps. I'm really good at React, React Native and Type Script, I'm pretty good at backends in NestJS and I am good enough in Rust on the bakcend too.

In my free time I'm usually spending time outside with my family or doing sports. I enjoy hacking on things, cooking and fixing things.
