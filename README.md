### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub Adamczyk, but you can call me Kuba (pronounced /koobah/).

I'm a software engineer based in Europe. My main area of expertise is making mobile apps. My technology of choice is usually React Native, but I also work with Native iOS technologies like SwiftUI, UIKit and AppKit.

When I'm not in front of the computer, you can find me at the gym, running in the park, hiking on a trail, cooking in the kitchen, walking my dog or chillin' on a sofa playing games
